# MNIST Classification using Neural Networks

This project implements a neural network model using Keras for classifying images in the MNIST dataset. The model can be customized with different hyperparameters such as the number of layers, neurons per layer, and the optimizer.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow (includes Keras)
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas
